### How to use:
1. First step is building local Phala stack (node, pruntime and pherry). Check [official guide](https://wiki.phala.network/en-us/build/archived/run-a-local-development-network/).
2. Start the local stack.  
You may also try using `/assets/dev-node/run.sh` which will prepare all components with proper configuration.
3. Build your contract
4. Use devPHAse to deploy / test
